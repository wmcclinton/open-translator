## ðŸ›  Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opentranslator.git
cd opentranslator
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
We recommend using `venv`:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### 3. Install Required Python Libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're not using `requirements.txt`, install manually:
```bash
pip install Flask gTTS pydub SpeechRecognition translators
```

### 4. Install ffmpeg
Required by `pydub` to convert between audio formats.

- **macOS** (with Homebrew):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
- **Windows**:
Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add it to your PATH.

### 5. Install ngrok (Optional for Public URL)
Go to: https://ngrok.com/download

Once installed:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN>
ngrok http 5050
```
This will expose your Flask server (running on port 5050) to a public URL.
